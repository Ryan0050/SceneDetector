## Frontend Setup (React)

The frontend provides the user interface.

### Instructions
1. Install dependencies (if running locally with Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser to the local address (usually `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173`).
